## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Vanilla Javascript plus a bit of Jquery


### What I learned

Since I am a beginner in Web Development and IT in general, this project helped me to practice with basic tools for layouts and styles (Flexbox, svg, gradients) and interactivity (animations and responsive navbars with Javascript).

It was also a good opportunity to experiment, for the first time, with a bit of more structured stylization, in particular with Sass.

### Continued development

The goal of my next projects will be to move further and further away from the "spaghetti-code" and make my code more structured and maintainable.
